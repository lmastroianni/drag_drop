Bug 1 

 1. Drag a piece onto 1 of the 4 available slots 
 2. Drop it 
 3. Drag another piece onto the same slot as the first 
 4. Drop it 
 5. Piece will reset to the ‘puzzle-pieces’ section (rather than disappearing)

Solution: 

To fix this, write an if statement that checks to see if the drop zone has a child. 
If the drop zone already has a child (a puzzle piece), return false in the event listener for 
dropping so that only one pieces is allowed in a single zone. In the HTML, the pieces can be targetted (0,1,2,and 3).
"Return False" anything greater than zero fixes this bug.
 
Bug 2
 1. Target the pieces on the board (JavaScript purposes)
 2. Click on a puzzle thumbnail other than the one you’re on 
 3. Once clicked, puzzle is reset
 4. Playing board is cleared
 5. Start a new puzzle 

Solution:

To fix this, remove all children (using removeChild) of the drop zone elements in the resetPuzzlePieces 
function before calling the createPuzzlePieces function. Add an event listener "click" so that the reset can be activated.
